# Dexical's RotMG DPS Calculator
Since no DPS Calculator seems to be updated or even just existing, I made my own.

This is WIP, abolutely not optimized, I'm still learning.
## How to use
You can just open this page : https://dexical.github.io/RotMG_DPS_Calculator/

Then input your total Dex and Att, choose a weapon and submit. You can submit as many as you want.

If you wanna add weapons and stuff on your own, you'll need a (local) server to run it, otherwise your browser won't authorize the file access.
## How to add a weapon
Weapons are stored in "resources/equipment/weapons" folder.

In there, you'll find a file called "template.json". You can copy this template and paste it in the weapon list and change the attributes as you wish. Don't forget to add a comma before you add a weapon to the list otherwise it won't work.

That's it ! You made a new weapon, try it out.
## Additional notes
This may seem like a complicated way of doing, I'm aware, but this will most probably in the future, stay tuned when I'll update it.

Take care.
