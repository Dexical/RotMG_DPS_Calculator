# Dexical's RotMG DPS Calculator
Since no DPS Calculator seems to be updated or even just existing, I made my own.

This is WIP, abolutely not optimized, I'm still learning.
## How to use
If you wanna use this, you'll need a server, otherwise your browser won't authorize the file access.

Open index.html.

Input your total Dex and Att, choose a weapon then submit. You can submit as many as you want.
## How to add a weapon
If you navigate to "../pages/insert_form.php" you'll find the form to add a new weapon in the database. Fill in the weapon's info and you're done !
## Additional notes
This is a pretty complicated way of doing, I'm aware, but this will all change in the future anyway, stay tuned when I'll update it.

Take care.
