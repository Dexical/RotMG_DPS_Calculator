# Dexical's RotMG DPS Calculator
Since no DPS Calculator seems to be updated or even just existing, I made my own.

This is WIP, abolutely not optimized, I'm still learning.
## How to use
You can just open this page : https://dexical.github.io/RotMG_DPS_Calculator/

Then input your total Dex and Att, choose a weapon and submit. You can submit as many as you want.

If you wanna add weapons and stuff on your own, you'll need a (local) server to run it, otherwise your browser won't authorize the file access.
## How to add a weapon
Weapons are stored in "resources/equipment/weapons" folder.

In there, you'll find a file called "template.json". You can copy this template in the weapon type you like and change the attributes as you wish.

When you're done, rename the file with this type of name "name_of_my_weapon.json". In every weapon's type folder you'll find "list.json". in there you'll have to add your weapon by its name. Your weapons name has to be the same as your files name but you can add capital letters and replace underscores by spaces like this : "Name of my Weapon".

That's it ! You made a new weapon, try it out.
## Additional notes
This is a pretty complicated way of doing, I'm aware, but this will all change in the future anyway, stay tuned when I'll update it.

Take care.
